# Lossless-Image-Compression
This project implements a lossless image compression system using Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Huffman Coding in MATLAB App Designer. The application allows users to load an image, convert it to grayscale, compress it, decompress it, and verify perfect image reconstruction. RLE reduces spatial redundancy by encoding repeated pixel values, while Huffman Coding applies entropy-based compression to minimize bit usage. The decompression process reverses both steps to recover the original image without any loss. Compression ratios are displayed to evaluate efficiency. The system is suitable for accuracy-critical domains such as medical imaging, satellite data, forensics, and digital archiving.
